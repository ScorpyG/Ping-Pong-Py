# Ping-Pong-Py
Ping Pong Py was a coding project of me and my friend created for grade 11 programming class.

*Important notices
- You will NEED to have pygame package installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Instuctions and tutorials are avaliable on the website

*Introduction*
The concept of this game is straight forward, there will be 2 players, each one will control a paddle using W/S or UP/DOWN arrow key. The objective is to score the ball into eachother goal. If the player scored, the code will trigger a sound function to notify the player that they've scored 1 point. Whoever scored 3 point first win the game (there is an infinite round version to this game as well) ~_^.

The project focuses on the introduction of GUI and the uses of pygame. There're concepts like items positioning inside the GUI, repetition, optimization, code structures and conditions of codes that being highlighted throughout the programming. This is a step-up from what we had with the guess game where mostly involve the foundation/fundamental concepts of programming
